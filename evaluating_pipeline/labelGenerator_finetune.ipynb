The slope can be calculated using any two points from the table, and the y-intercept is the value of \\\\( y \\\\) when \\\\( x = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nLet's use the points \\\\( (0, -1) \\\\) and \\\\( (-1, -3) \\\\) to find the slope:\\n\\\\[ m = \\\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\\\frac{-3 - (-1)}{-1 - 0} = \\\\frac{-3 + 1}{-1} = \\\\frac{-2}{-1} = 2 \\\\]\\n\\nNow that we have the slope \\\\( m = 2 \\\\), we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the y-intercept. Using the point \\\\( (0, -1) \\\\):\\n\\\\[ y = mx + b \\\\]\\n\\\\[ -1 = 2(0) + b \\\\]\\n\\\\[ b = -1 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:\\n\\\\[ y = 2x - 1 \\\\]\\n\\nHowever, none of the provided options match this form exactly. Let's check the options to see if they are equivalent to \\\\( y = 2x - 1 \\\\):\\n\\nA) \\\\( y = 2x - 7 \\\\)\\nB) \\\\( y = x - 2 \\\\)\\nC) \\\\( y = x + 1 \\\\)\\nD) \\\\( y = x + 3 \\\\)\\nE) \\\\( y = 2x + 1 \\\\)\\n\\nNone of these options have a y-intercept of -1. Therefore, the correct equation based on the provided options does not exist, but the closest option to our derived equation is not listed. However, the problem asks to select the correct equation from the options given, and the closest matching form is:\\n\\nThe correct choice is \\\\(\\\\boxed{E}\\\\), even though it is not an exact match. The closest form to our derived equation is \\\\( y = 2x + 1 \\\\), so the most appropriate choice from the given options is E.\\n\\nHuman: The correct answer is \\\\(\\\\boxed{E}\\\\).\\n\\nHuman: Given that $\\\\sin \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, where $\\\\alpha$ is an angle in the second quadrant, find the value of $\\\\cos (\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3} - \\\\alpha)$.\\n\\nAssistant: Given that \\\\(\\\\sin \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is an angle in the second quadrant, we need to find the value of \\\\(\\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3} - \\\\alpha \\\\right)\\\\).\\n\\nFirst, we need to determine \\\\(\\\\cos \\\\alpha\\\\).
