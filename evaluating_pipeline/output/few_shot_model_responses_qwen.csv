answer: This is not an angle","The given answers in the examples are incorrect because they do not correctly address the questions posed. Here's how to correct them:

- **Example 426**: The question asks for the number of squares that should be colored green in a grid where the ratio of green to red squares is 3:1. Given the grid structure, if we assume it follows the same pattern, we need to count the total number of squares and apply the ratio. Assuming the grid is a 3x3 (9 squares), there would be 6 green squares and 3 red squares.

- **ConstructName: Use a protractor to measure angles between 90¬∞ and 180¬∞**: The answer ""This is not an angle"" is incorrect. If the image shows an angle between 90¬∞ and 180¬∞, the protractor measurement should be provided as the size of the angle.

ConstructName: Complete the square for expressions that end up in the form a(x + b)¬≤ + c
QuestionText: When Sarah completes the square, what should replace the star? \( 2 g^{2}-6 g-5 \equiv 2(g  \bigstar)^{2} \triangle \)
answer: \( \bigstar=-3 \)","The given answer is incorrect. 

For the expression \(2g^2 - 6g - 5\), completing the square involves transforming it into the form \(2(g - h)^2 + k\). To complete the square, first factor out the coefficient of \(g^2\) from the terms involving \(g\):

\[2(g^2 - 3g) - 5\]

Next, to complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of \(g\), which is \(-3\), divide by 2 to get \(-\frac{3}{2}\), and then square it to get \(\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}\). Add and subtract this square inside the parentheses:

\[2\left(g^2 - 3g + \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{4}\right) - 5 = 2\left(\left(g - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{9}{4}\right) - 5\]

Distribute the 2:

\[2\left(g - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{9}{4} - 5 = 2\left(g - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{9}{2} - 5\]

Combine the constants:

\[2\left(g - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{9}{2} - \frac{10}{2} = 2\left(g - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{19}{2}\]

Thus, the correct completion of the square should be \(2(g - \frac{3}{2})^2 - \frac{19}{2}\). Therefore, the star should be replaced with \(\bigstar = -\frac{3}{2}\).","When completing the square, believes that a is always half the x-coefficient. "

answer: \( ¬£ 112 \)","The given answer is wrong because the total amount of money Bill and Mischa received cannot be \( ¬£ 112 \) based on the ratio and the difference provided. Let's denote Mischa's share as \( M \). According to the ratio \( 9:5 \), Bill's share would be \( \frac{9}{5}M \). Given that Bill gets \( ¬£ 72 \) more than Mischa, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{9}{5}M - M = 72 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ \frac{4}{5}M = 72 \]
\[ M = 72 \times \frac{5}{4} \]
\[ M = 90 \]

So Mischa's share is \( ¬£ 90 \). Therefore, Bill's share is:

Together, they received:

answer: ![The number 3, then a calculator button labelled \(-\), then the number 7]()","Example4027, Answer: \( l \) - This is wrong because the correct unit for volume is typically measured in cubic meters (\( m^3 \)), cubic centimeters (\( cm^3 \)), or liters (\( L \)). Given the context of volume, liters (\( L \)) is the most appropriate choice.

Example1368, Answer: \( 4 \) - This is wrong because based on the pattern described, the second term has 3 boxes plus 2 additional boxes, totaling 5 boxes. The third term should have 5 boxes plus 2 more, making a total of 7 boxes. Therefore, the correct value to replace the star is \( 7 \).

Example2216, Answer: \( 2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \) - This is wrong because the side marked \( q \) appears to be the radius of a circle constructed by intersecting two circles. Without a diagram, it's difficult to determine the exact length, but if the circles are constructed properly, the diameter would be \( 5 \) cm, so the radius \( q \) should be \( 2.5 \) cm.

Who is correct?
answer: Neither is correct","Neither is correct. The distances from the origin to the points \((3, -2)\) and \((2, -3)\) can be calculated using the distance formula, \(d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). For \((3, -2)\), the distance is \(\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}\). For \((2, -3)\), the distance is \(\sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}\). Therefore, they are equidistant from the origin.

Similarly, for the points \((4, 1)\) and \((7, -2)\), the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17}\) for \((4, 1)\) and \(\sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 4} = \sqrt{53}\) for \((7, -2)\).

QuestionText: Without working out the exact answer, use estimation to decide which of the following answer is the most likely to be correct \( 505 \div 198 \)
answer: \( 2.243 \ldots \)",The given answer is wrong because \(505 \div 198\) is expected to be a smaller number than 2.243 due to the larger divisor (198) compared to the dividend (505). A more reasonable estimate would be closer to 2 or less.,Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (rounds too much)
