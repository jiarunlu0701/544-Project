answer: \( 6 \)","The given answer is wrong.

The correct calculation for the area of a trapezium when the parallel sides are given in different units (millimeters and centimeters) should be done consistently in either millimeters or centimeters. Here, the formula provided is:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{(90 + 40)}{2} \times \bigstar \]

Since the height is given in centimeters (5 cm), the parallel sides should also be converted to centimeters for consistency. 

The lengths 90 mm and 40 mm need to be converted to centimeters:
- 90 mm = 9 cm
- 40 mm = 4 cm

Thus, the formula becomes:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{(9 + 4)}{2} \times \bigstar = \frac{13}{2} \times \bigstar = 6.5 \times \bigstar \]

answer: \( \triangle=-16 \)","The given answer is wrong. The correct answer should be \( \triangle = -43 \). To complete the square for the expression \(3g^2 - 18g - 7\), first factor out the coefficient of \(g^2\) from the first two terms:

Kay's company paid her \( ¬£ 80 \)

How many miles did she travel?
answer: \( 64 \)","The given answer is wrong under the following circumstances:

For the question ""ConstructName: Read values off a real life graph"", the correct answer should be calculated using the inverse relationship between the cost and distance from the graph.

Given:
- 10 miles = ¬£8

To find out how many miles correspond to ¬£80:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Cost per mile}} = \frac{80}{8/10} = \frac{80 \times 10}{8} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

The correct calculation for the perpendicular height \( h \) should involve using the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 45 \, \text{cm}^2\). Given \( a = 10 \, \text{cm} \) and \( b = 5 \, \text{cm} \), solving for \( h \) yields:
\[
h = \frac{2 \times 45}{10 + 5} = \frac{90}{15} = 6 \, \text{cm}
\]
So the correct answer is \( h = 6 \, \text{cm} \).

For Example 78:
The first mistake in the proof occurs in Line 1 where the terms are incorrectly combined. The correct simplification from Line 1 to Line 2 should be:
\[
n^2 + 2n + 1 - (n^2 - 2n + 1) = 4n
\]
So the correct answer is Line 1.

For Example 1863:
The sequence given is the cubes of natural numbers: \(1^3, 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, \ldots\). So the correct answer is ""cubes of natural numbers"".

For Example 1457:
The calculation for the division is incorrect. The correct result is:
\[
\frac{3.24 \times 17.6}{0.224} \approx 264
\]
So the correct answer is not \( 12 \).

For Example 3086:
The diagram does not show an angle of \(135^\circ\). The correct diagram should show an angle formed by the intersection of two lines or a protractor marked with such an angle. Therefore, the correct answer is not the provided diagram.

For the last example:
The solution to the system of equations is incorrect. Solving the equations:
\[ 4x + y = 7 \]
\[ 3x + 2y = 4 \]
Multiplying the first equation by 2 gives:
\[ 8x + 2y = 14 \]

Explanation: If for every 3 green squares there is 1 red square, and assuming the grid is fully filled as typical in such problems, the total ratio would be 4 parts (3 green + 1 red). Since the grid has 16 spaces, dividing 16 by 4 gives 4 squares per part, meaning there should be \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) green squares and \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) red squares.

Paul says \( (-4,10) \) lies on the line \( \mathbf{4} \boldsymbol{x}-\mathbf{5 y}=\mathbf{2 0} \)

Who is correct?
answer: Only
Jo","The given answer is incorrect. 

Jo is correct because when substituting \( (10, -4) \) into the equation \( 4x - 5y = 20 \):
\[ 4(10) - 5(-4) = 40 + 20 = 60 \neq 20 \]

However, Paul's statement is also incorrect because substituting \( (-4, 10) \) into the equation:
\[ 4(-4) - 5(10) = -16 - 50 = -66 \neq 20 \]

Therefore, neither Jo nor Paul is correct; both points do not lie on the line defined by the equation \( 4x - 5y = 20 \).","When subtracting a negative number from a positive number, uses a method which assumes one of the negative signs can be ignored "

answer: Only
Tom","The given answer is wrong because both Tom and Katie's methods are actually correct. Tom‚Äôs method correctly uses the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon divided by the number of sides, while Katie‚Äôs method calculates the measure of one exterior angle first and then subtracts it from \(360^\circ\) to find the interior angle. Both approaches yield the same result for the interior angle of a regular 18-sided polygon. Therefore, neither is entirely incorrect; they are both valid ways to solve the problem.",Believes an interior angle in a regular polygon can be found using 180(n+2)/n

QuestionText: According to the graph, what is the approximate solution to
\(x^{2}-x-9=-6\) ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=x^2-x-9 drawn on.]()
answer: \( x=-9 \)","The given answer is wrong because it does not solve the equation \(x^2 - x - 9 = -6\) correctly. The correct approach would be to simplify the equation first:

\[ x^2 - x - 9 = -6 \]
\[ x^2 - x - 3 = 0 \]

Then, solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -3\):

\[ x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2} \]

So the correct solutions are approximately \( x \approx 2.303 \) and \( x \approx -1.303 \). Therefore, the answer should be \( x \approx 2.303 \) or \( x \approx -1.303 \).",Finds the y intercept when asked to read the solution to a quadratic equation from a graph

- Distance to origin for \((4, 1)\): \( \sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17} \)

A straight line goes from the origin and passes through (35,20) (not marked - just a point it goes through) but extends the whole way up the graph.]()
answer: \( 85 \) pints","The given answer is wrong under these circumstances.

For the conversion graph question, the line passes through the points (35, 20), indicating that 35 units on the x-axis correspond to 20 units on the y-axis. To find the number of pints equivalent to 50 liters, we need to determine the scale factor between the x and y axes. Since 35 units on the x-axis corresponds to 20 units on the y-axis, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{35}{20} = \frac{50}{x} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50 \times 20}{35} = \frac{1000}{35} \approx 28.57 \]

The correct calculation for the area of a right-angled triangle involves using the base and height (which are perpendicular to each other). Here, the base is 12 cm and the height is 9 cm. The formula for the area \( A \) of a right-angled triangle is:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the given values:

Given the bases of the smaller and larger trapeziums, the correct calculation would involve setting up a proportion based on their similarity ratio:

\[
\frac{y}{60} = \frac{70}{150}

Solving for \( y \):

The correct approach involves using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\). Given the angles labeled as \(s\), \(2s\), \(2s\), and \(3s\), the equation for the sum of the interior angles is:

\[ s + 2s + 2s + 3s = 360^\circ \]

answer: To get the next term you add \( 6 \) to the previous term","The given answer is wrong under such circumstances because the term-to-term rule described does not accurately generate the sequence provided. The correct term-to-term rule should be that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2 and then adding 2. For example:

- Starting with 4, \( 4 \times 2 + 2 = 10 \)
- Next, \( 10 \times 2 + 2 = 22 \), but the next given term is 28, indicating the rule needs adjustment.
- Correcting the pattern, if we start again correctly: \( 4 \times 2 + 2 = 10 \), then \( 10 \times 2 + 2 = 22 \), and \( 22 \times 2 + 2 = 46 \), but the sequence continues as 28, suggesting the initial rule might need reevaluation.

Given the sequence 4, 10, 28, 82, the correct term-to-term rule should be that each term is twice the previous term plus 4. This results in:
- \( 4 \times 2 + 4 = 12 \) (but the sequence shows 10, so there's an inconsistency here).
- Correctly, starting again: \( 4 \times 2 + 4 = 12 \), then \( 12 \times 2 + 4 = 28 \), and \( 28 \times 2 + 4 = 60 \), but the sequence shows 82, indicating the rule is still incorrect.

The correct answer should be **A**. 

When reflecting a point across a horizontal line, the vertical distance of the point from the line remains the same, but its horizontal position changes.

answer: \( x=-1 \)","The given answer is wrong because the graph does not show \(x = -1\) as a solution to the equation \(x^2 + 4x - 1 = -6\). The correct solution can be found by solving the equation algebraically or by analyzing the graph more closely. Solving the equation:
