QuestionText: Tom and Katie are discussing linear sequences Tom says this is a linear sequence: ![Three shapes made of squares. The first is an L-shape made of 3 squares so the bottom line is two squares long. The second shape is also an L but with a bottom line of three squares. The fourth shape is the same but the bottom line is four squares long.  ]() Katie says this is a linear sequence: ![Three shapes made of squares. The first is an L-shape made of 3 squares. The second shape is an L made of 5 squares, two on the top row and three on the bottom row. The third shape is an L made of 7 squares, 3 on the top row and four on the bottom. ]() Who is correct?","Neither is correct

Explanation:
The given sequences are not linear sequences. A linear sequence is one where each term increases or decreases by a constant difference. 

In Tom's sequence:
- From the first shape to the second, the difference is +2 (3 to 5).
- From the second shape to the third, the difference is +2 (5 to 7).

So, Tom's sequence indeed shows a constant difference of +2, and thus it is a linear sequence.

In Katie's sequence:
- From the first shape to the second, the difference is +2 (3 to 5).
- From the second shape to the third, the difference is +3 (5 to 8).

Katie's sequence does not have a constant difference; the differences are +2 and +3 respectively. Therefore, Katie's sequence is not linear.

Hence, Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect.",Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount

ConstructName: Solve two-step linear equations, with the variable on one side, with all positive integers
QuestionText: Tom and Katie are arguing about a first step to solve this equation:
\(
4(m-1)=20
\)
Tom says you can write: \( 4 m=21 \)
Katie says you can write: \( m-1=5 \)
Who is correct?","Katie is correct.

Starting with the equation:
\[ 4(m-1) = 20 \]

First, distribute the 4 on the left side:
\[ 4m - 4 = 20 \]

Then, add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable:
\[ 4m = 24 \]

So, Katie's step of rewriting it as:
\[ m - 1 = 5 \]

Is incorrect because she missed adding 4 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable \( m \). Tom's step of rewriting it as:
\[ 4m = 21 \]

Is also incorrect because he missed adding 4 to both sides, resulting in \( 4m = 24 \).

Therefore, Katie's step of \( m - 1 = 5 \) is wrong. Tom‚Äôs step of \( 4m = 21 \) is also wrong. The correct first step is:
\[ m - 1 = 5 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ m = 6 \]

So, Katie is not correct. Tom is also not correct. The correct answer is neither, and the provided options suggest that both Tom and Katie are wrong. Thus, the correct response is:

QuestionText: Jane measures the length and width of her rectangular classroom as \( 9.1 \mathrm{~m} \) and \( 11.7 \mathrm{~m} \).
Which calculation will give the best estimate of the area?","The given answer is wrong under such circumstances because the instruction asks for the best estimate of the area of the rectangular classroom. The best estimate would be obtained by rounding the measurements to the nearest whole number before calculating the area.

Jane's measurements are \( 9.1 \mathrm{~m} \) and \( 11.7 \mathrm{~m} \).

Rounding these measurements to the nearest whole number:
- \( 9.1 \mathrm{~m} \) rounds to \( 9 \mathrm{~m} \)
- \( 11.7 \mathrm{~m} \) rounds to \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \)

Now, calculate the area using these rounded values:
\[ \text{Estimated Area} = 9 \mathrm{~m} \times 12 \mathrm{~m} = 108 \mathrm{~m}^2 \]

Using the original measurements (\( 9.1 \mathrm{~m} \) and \( 11.7 \mathrm{~m} \)) to calculate the actual area:
\[ \text{Actual Area} = 9.1 \mathrm{~m} \times 11.7 \mathrm{~m} \approx 106.47 \mathrm{~m}^2 \]

The estimated area of \( 108 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) is closer to the actual area of \( 106.47 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) than the actual area of \( 106.47 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) itself. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The provided iterative formula is:
\[ x_{n+1} = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{x_n^3}{9} \]

Starting with \( x_0 = 0 \), let's compute the first few iterations:

1. **First Iteration (\( x_1 \))**:
\[ x_1 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0^3}{9} = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.8889 \]

2. **Second Iteration (\( x_2 \))**:
\[ x_2 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{\left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^3}{9} = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{\left(\frac{512}{729}\right)}{9} = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{512}{6561} \]
\[ x_2 = \frac{8 \cdot 729 - 512}{6561} = \frac{5832 - 512}{6561} = \frac{5320}{6561} \approx 0.8087 \]

\[ x_3 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{\left(\frac{5320}{6561}\right)^3}{9} \]
This value is very close to the result from the second iteration.

Given that \( x_2 \approx 0.8087 \) and the subsequent iterations will converge very closely to this value, the correct value of \( x \) to 3 decimal places is approximately 0.809.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Given:
\[
\frac{t-3}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Step 1: Eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by 2.
\[
t - 3 = \frac{1}{8} \times 2
\]
\[
t - 3 = \frac{1 \times 2}{8}
\]
\[
t - 3 = \frac{2}{8}
\]
Simplify \(\frac{2}{8}\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).
\[
t - 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Step 2: Add 3 to both sides to isolate \(t\).
\[
t = \frac{1}{4} + 3
\]

To add \(\frac{1}{4}\) and 3, convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 4.
\[
3 = \frac{12}{4}
\]
\[
t = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{12}{4}
\]
\[
t = \frac{1 + 12}{4}
\]
\[
t = \frac{13}{4}
\]

Thus, the correct solution is:
\[
t = \frac{13}{4} = 3\frac{1}{4}

Tom says a vertex of the square could be \( (2,-2) \).

Katie says a vertex of the square could be \( (1,5) \).
Who is correct?","Only Katie

Explanation:
To determine which vertex is correct, we need to find the properties of the square based on the given line segment from (0,2) to (3,1).

First, calculate the length of the line segment:
\[ \text{Length} = \sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (1-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 1} = \sqrt{10} \]

This length is the side length of the square. Now, let's find the slope of the line segment to determine the direction and verify the other vertices.

The slope of the line segment is:
\[ \text{slope} = \frac{1-2}{3-0} = -\frac{1}{3} \]

The slope of the adjacent sides of the square will be the negative reciprocal of \(-\frac{1}{3}\), which is 3.

Now, let's check Tom's and Katie's proposed vertices:

1. **Tom's Vertex**: \( (2, -2) \)

   Check if it forms a square with the given line segment:
   - Distance from (0,2) to (2,-2):
     \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (-2-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]
     This is not equal to \(\sqrt{10}\), so (2,-2) cannot be a vertex of the square.

2. **Katie's Vertex**: \( (1, 5) \)

   Check if it forms a square with the given line segment:
   - Distance from (0,2) to (1,5):
     \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10} \]
     This is equal to the side length of the square.
   
   - Check the slope of the line from (1,5) to (3,1):
     \[ \text{slope} = \frac{1-5}{3-1} = -2 \]
     This slope is the negative reciprocal of \(-\frac{1}{3}\), confirming it is perpendicular to the given line segment.

Who is correct?","Both Tom and Katie

The provided expressions and factorizations are incorrect.

For the expression \( x^2 + 5x + 6 \):
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) \]
This is because \( (x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x + 6 \).

For the expression \( x^2 - 5x - 6 \):
\[ x^2 - 5x - 6 = (x - 6)(x + 1) \]
This is because \( (x - 6)(x + 1) = x^2 + x - 6x - 6 = x^2 - 5x - 6 \).

QuestionText: What is a correct solution for the following pair of simultaneous equations:
\[4x+y=7\]
\[3x+2y=4\]","The given answer \(x=0.6, y=4.6\) is incorrect for the provided system of simultaneous equations:

\[4x + y = 7\]
\[3x + 2y = 4\]

To solve this, let's use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we'll eliminate \(y\) by making the coefficients of \(y\) in both equations the same. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2:

\[2(4x + y) = 2(7)\]
\[8x + 2y = 14\]

Now we have:
\[8x + 2y = 14\]
\[3x + 2y = 4\]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first:

\[(8x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 14 - 4\]
\[8x + 2y - 3x - 2y = 10\]
\[5x = 10\]
\[x = 2\]

Now that we have \(x = 2\), we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find \(y\). Let's use the first equation:

\[4x + y = 7\]
\[4(2) + y = 7\]
\[8 + y = 7\]
\[y = 7 - 8\]
\[y = -1\]

So the correct solution is:
\[x = 2, y = -1\]

Therefore, the given answer \(x=0.6, y=4.6\) is wrong.","When asked to solve simultaneous equations, believes they can just find values that work in one equation"

By how much did the plant grow in total?","The given answer is \( 35-7 \), which is incorrect based on the problem statement. The correct approach to solve this problem involves multiplication.

### Analysis:
- Fred‚Äôs plant grows \( 7 \) cm every week.
- It grows for \( 35 \) weeks.

To find the total growth, we need to multiply the weekly growth by the number of weeks:
\[ \text{Total Growth} = 7 \, \text{cm/week} \times 35 \, \text{weeks} \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ \text{Total Growth} = 245 \, \text{cm} \]

### Correct Calculation:
\[ 7 \times 35 = 245 \]

So, the correct answer should be \( 245 \).

The triangle has a base of 40 cm and a perpendicular height of 15 cm, but the slant height of 25 cm is not necessary to calculate the area of an isosceles triangle with these base and height.

To find the size of each interior angle in a regular polygon, you typically use the formula:
\[ \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n} \]
where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon.

For a 18-sided polygon (\( n = 18 \)):
\[ \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(18-2) \times 180^\circ}{18} = \frac{16 \times 180^\circ}{18} = 160^\circ \]

Katie's calculation:
\[ 360^\circ - \frac{180^\circ}{18} = 360^\circ - 10^\circ = 350^\circ \]
This result is not correct for the interior angle of a regular polygon. The interior angle should be less than 180¬∞.

Tom's calculation:
\[ \frac{20 \times 180^\circ}{18} = \frac{3600^\circ}{18} = 200^\circ \]
This result is also incorrect as it exceeds 180¬∞ and does not correspond to the interior angle of a regular 18-sided polygon.

The top row is one box, centered over the join of the two below, it is empty.]()","Only Paul is correct. 

In the addition pyramid, each number in the top row is obtained by adding the two numbers directly below it. Following this rule:

- The number directly below the star (2g) and the empty box (which we assume is 0) should sum to the number in the row above.

So, \( 2g + 0 = 2g \).

- This number (2g) then adds to the number directly below it (4f) to produce the number in the top row.

So, \( 4f + 2g \) should be the number in the top row.

However, the provided answer is \(x = -9\). This is incorrect because:

1. **Equation Simplification**: The equation \(x^2 - x - 9 = -6\) simplifies to \(x^2 - x + 3 = 0\).
2. **Quadratic Formula**: To solve \(x^2 - x + 3 = 0\), we use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = 3\).

2. Rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal:
   \[

3. Factorize the denominator \(9x^2 - 1\):

For the inequality \(d \geq h\):
- Both \(d\) and \(h\) must be integers.
- \(d\) must be greater than or equal to \(h\).

Given the provided pair:
- \(d = 2\)
- \(h = 2\)

Since \(2 \geq 2\) is true, this pair fits the inequality. However, the instruction asks for a pair that **does not** fit the inequality.

The correct pair that does not fit \(d \geq h\) would be a pair where \(d < h\).

So, the correct pair that does not fit the inequality \(d \geq h\) is:
\[ d = -1, h = 2 \]

Given the data:

\( \{x<-4\} \cup\{x>4\} \)

However, the inequality \(x^2 < 16\) can be solved by taking the square root of both sides while considering the domain where the square root is defined. Here's the correct approach:

Given \(x^2 < 16\), we take the square root of both sides:

\(\sqrt{x^2} < \sqrt{16}\)

Since \(\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\), we get:

\[|x| < 4\]

This inequality means that \(x\) must be between \(-4\) and \(4\) but not equal to \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the solution is:

\(-4 < x < 4\)

Explanation:
When reflecting a shape across a vertical line, the reflection will map each point to its symmetric counterpart on the other side of the line of reflection, maintaining the same distance from the line. 

In this case:
- Point \(P\) is 5 squares up from the red line.
- Point \(Q\) is 3 squares up from the red line.

Reflecting the rectangle across the red line:
- Point \(P\) (which is 5 squares up) will be reflected to a position 5 squares down.
- Point \(Q\) (which is 3 squares up) will be reflected to a position 3 squares down.

So, both points \(P\) and \(Q\) will move, not stay in the same position. Therefore, neither Tom nor Katie is correct.",Does not understand that a point on the line of reflection will stay the same when reflected

- \(0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02\)
- \(0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02\)
- \(0.21 - 0.2 = 0.01\)
- \(0.45 - 0.2 = 0.25\)
- \(0.45 - 0.21 = 0.24\)

The value \(0.45\) (which is \(\frac{9}{20}\)) has the largest deviation from the others, making it the outlier.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\frac{9}{20}\) (or \(0.45\)), not \(\frac{2}{10}\).",Believes an outlier is a value that does not fit the same characteristics as the other values

ConstructName: Solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula where the coefficient of x¬≤ is not 1 
QuestionText: One of these quadratic equations will give exactly one solution.
Which one?","The given answer is wrong because the provided quadratic equation does not result in exactly one solution. Let's analyze the options:

The general form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). The quadratic formula to solve this equation is:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Given the instruction to solve using the quadratic formula where the coefficient of \(x^2\) is not 1, let's assume the quadratic equation is in the form \(Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\) where \(A \neq 1\).

One condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution is that the discriminant (\(\Delta\)) must be zero. The discriminant is given by:
\[ \Delta = B^2 - 4AC \]

For the equation to have exactly one solution, \(\Delta\) must be equal to zero.

Let's assume one of the given equations is:
\[ 5x^2 - 15x + 9 = 0 \]

Here, \(A = 5\), \(B = -15\), and \(C = 9\). Let's calculate the discriminant:
\[ \Delta = (-15)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 9 = 225 - 180 = 45 \]

Since \(\Delta = 45 \neq 0\), this equation will have two distinct real solutions.

Now, let's consider the given equation:
\[ \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{5} \]

This equation suggests a complex number under the square root, indicating the presence of imaginary numbers:
\[ \sqrt{-16} = 4i \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{-3 \pm 4i}{5} \]

This is a quadratic equation with two complex solutions:
\[ x = \frac{-3 + 4i}{5} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-3 - 4i}{5} \]

Since the solutions are complex, this equation does not have real solutions.

Therefore, none of the provided equations will give exactly one solution under the given conditions. The question might be referring to a different form or a different equation that meets the condition of having exactly one solution. 

However, based on the given options and the form of the equation, the provided answer is incorrect. The correct answer should be one of the equations where the discriminant is zero, but since none of the provided equations meet this criterion, the given answer is not valid for the provided options.",Believes you can square root a negative number

\( 52\% \) can be converted to a decimal by dividing 52 by 100, which equals 0.52. Therefore, \( 52\% = 0.52 \).

To determine who is correct about \( 52\% \) compared to \( \frac{20}{41} \):

First, convert \( 52\% \) to a decimal:
\[ 52\% = 0.52 \]

Next, convert \( \frac{20}{41} \) to a decimal:
\[ \frac{20}{41} \approx 0.4878 \]

Comparing the two values:
\[ 0.52 > 0.4878 \]

Therefore, \( 52\% > \frac{20}{41} \).

QuestionText: Tom and Katie are arguing about midpoints.
\( M \) is the midpoint between points \( P \) and \( Q \).

Tom says if you know the location of \( M \) only, then there is more than one possible location for \( \mathrm{P} \) and \( \mathrm{Q} \).

Katie says if you only know the locations of \( M \) and \( Q \), then there is more than one possible location for \( \mathrm{P} \).
Who is correct?","Neither is correct.

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Given Information**:
   - \( M \) is the midpoint between points \( P \) and \( Q \).
   - All coordinates are integers.
   - At least one coordinate is negative.

2. **Midpoint Formula**:
   The midpoint \( M \) of a line segment joining points \( P(x_1, y_1) \) and \( Q(x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
   \[
   M\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)
   \]

3. **Analyzing Tom's Statement**:
   - If we know \( M \), we can express the coordinates of \( M \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \).
   - However, since \( M \) is known, we can determine the coordinates of \( P \) and \( Q \) uniquely if we know one of them.
   - Given that all coordinates are integers, the values of \( x_1, x_2, y_1, \) and \( y_2 \) must be such that their averages result in integer values for \( x \) and \( y \).
   - There is only one combination of \( x_1, x_2, y_1, \) and \( y_2 \) that will yield the same midpoint \( M \) for a given \( M \).

4. **Analyzing Katie's Statement**:
   - If we know \( M \) and \( Q \), we can determine the coordinates of \( P \).
   - Knowing \( M \) and \( Q \), we can find the midpoint \( M \) and use it to find \( P \).
   - Again, since all coordinates are integers, there is only one set of coordinates for \( P \) that will satisfy the midpoint condition with the given \( Q \) and \( M \).

Since both statements are based on the same logical reasoning and given conditions, neither Tom nor Katie is correct. The correct answer is that there is only one possible location for \( P \) given \( M \) and \( Q \).

Therefore, the correct response is that both Tom and Katie are incorrect.",Believes that one point is enough to specify a line

Let's analyze the positions of the vertices of the trapezia to determine the correct translation vector.

For object \( P \):
- Vertex at (1, 7)
- Vertex at (2, 9)
- Vertex at (4, 9)
- Vertex at (5, 7)

For object \( Q \):
- Vertex at (4, 2)
- Vertex at (5, 4)
- Vertex at (7, 4)
- Vertex at (8, 2)

To find the translation vector, we need to determine the change in coordinates from any point in \( P \) to the corresponding point in \( Q \).

Let's use the vertex (1, 7) from \( P \) and find its corresponding vertex in \( Q \):
- Vertex (1, 7) in \( P \) maps to (4, 2) in \( Q \).

Now, let's calculate the change in coordinates:
- Change in x-coordinate: \( 4 - 1 = 3 \)
- Change in y-coordinate: \( 2 - 7 = -5 \)

So, the translation vector is \( \left(\begin{array}{c}3 \\ -5\end{array}\right) \).

This vector indicates a translation 3 units to the right and 5 units down.

If there were \( 540 \) people at the wedding, which of the following would calculate how many people chose pork? ![A pie chart split into four parts, labelled with meal choices. The part for Beef is 150 degrees, Pork is 40 degrees and Other is 80 degrees. The angle for Vegetarian is labelled with a square right angle symbol.]()","The given answer is wrong under such circumstances because the provided formula \(\frac{360}{40} \times 540\) does not correctly represent the calculation needed to determine the number of people who chose pork.

To find the number of people who chose pork, you need to:

1. Determine the fraction of the total number of people that the pork sector represents.
2. Multiply this fraction by the total number of people at the wedding.

From the pie chart:
- Pork sector angle = 40 degrees.
- Total angle of a circle = 360 degrees.

First, find the fraction of the total that 40 degrees represents:
\[
\text{Fraction of people who chose pork} = \frac{40}{360} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Next, multiply this fraction by the total number of people (540):
\[
\text{Number of people who chose pork} = \frac{1}{9} \times 540 = 60
\]

So, the correct answer should be 60 people, not \(\frac{360}{40} \times 540\).

- \( d = 0 \) and \( h = -4 \): \( 0 \geq -4 \) (True)
- \( d = 2 \) and \( h = -3 \): \( 2 \geq -3 \) (True)
- \( d = -1 \) and \( h = -5 \): \( -1 \geq -5 \) (False)

From the above, the pair \( d = -1 \) and \( h = -5 \) does not fit the inequality \( d \geq h \) because \( -1 \not\geq -5 \).

So, the pair that does not fit the inequality is \( \begin{array}{c}d=-1 \\ h=-5\end{array} \).",Mixes up greater than and less than symbols
